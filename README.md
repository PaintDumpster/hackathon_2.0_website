# **BUILD A SERVER!**
- THE AIM OF THIS HACKTHON IS TO BUILD A WESITE THAT HAS DYNAMIC URL AND SERVES A FUNCTION TO OUR STUDIO PROJECT.

**OUR IDEA OF WHAT THE WEBSITE SHOULD DO IS THE FOLLOWING:**<br>

build a community platform were users of our plugin can upload their models and download others peoples models.<br>

the website should be able to host the models.<br>

should be able to have a history of editing of models.<br>

user metrics.<br>

mayyyybe host the nn that we use to generate the models (like meshy).<br>
