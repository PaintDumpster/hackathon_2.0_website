# **BUILD A SERVER!**
> THE AIM OF THIS HACKATHON IS TO BUILD A WEB APP BASED ON THE FLASK LIBRARY. THE APP SHOULD HAVE HAVE DYNAMIC URLS AND GET/POST FUNCTIONS. THE APP SHOULD SERVE IN SME WAY TO OUR STUDIO PROJECT.

**OUR IDEA OF WHAT THE WEBSITE SHOULD DO IS THE FOLLOWING:**<br>

1. build a community platform where users of our plugin can upload their models and download others peoples models.<br>

2. the website should be able to host the 3D models.<br>

3. should be able to have a history of editing of models.(In development)<br>

4. To show user metrics.<br>

5. **Mayyyybe** host the The finetuned models that we use to generate the the 3D geometries (like meshyAI).<br>
