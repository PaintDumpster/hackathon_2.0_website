## **OUR GENERAL IDEA:**
THIS IS A WEB APP BASED ON FLASK. THE WEB APP SERVES AS AN ONLINE EXTENSION FOR OUR 3RD TERM STUDIO PROJECT. FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROJECT, PLEASE VISIT THE [PROJECT'S REPOSITORY](https://github.com/PaintDumpster/Applied_research_studio).

## **OUR IDEA OF WHAT THE WEB APP SHOULD HAVE IS THE FOLLOWING:**<br>

1. build a community platform where users of our plugin can upload their models and download others peoples models.<br>

2. the website should be able to host the 3D models.<br>

3. should be able to have a history of editing of models.(In development)<br>

4. Allow user signup and login.<br>

5. host the The finetuned models that we use to generate the the 3D geometries using trellis ai.<br>
